<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>Now that petrol is being increased by eightpence a gallon, pedestrians
  will shortly have to be content to be knocked down by horsed vehicles or
  hand trucks.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Moleskins, says a news item, are now worth eighteen-pence each. It is
  only fair to add that the moles do not admit the accuracy of these
  figures.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Three hundred pounds is the price asked by an advertiser in <i>The
  Times</i> for a motor-coat lined with Persian lamb. It is still possible
  to get a waistcoat lined with English lamb (or even good capon) for a
  mere fraction of that sum.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Charged with impersonation at a municipal election a defendant told
  the Carlisle Bench that it was only a frolic. The Bench, entering into
  the spirit of the thing, told the man to go and have a good frisk in the
  second division.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Steamers carrying coal from Dover to Calais," says a news item, "are
  bringing back champagne." It is characteristic of the period that we
  should thus exchange the luxuries of life for its necessities.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Charged at Willesden with travelling without a ticket a Walworth girl
  was stated to have a mania for travelling on the Tube. The Court
  missionary thought that a position could probably be obtained for her as
  scrum-half at a West End bargain-counter.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A correspondent writes to a London paper to say that he heard a lark
  in full song on Sunday. We can only suppose that the misguided bird did
  not know it was Sunday.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A medical man refers to the case of a woman who has no sense of time,
  proportion or numbers. There should be a great chance for her as a
  telephone operator.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Owing to its weed-choked condition," says <i>The Evening News</i>,
  "the Thames is going to ruin." Unless something is done at once it is
  feared that this famous river may have to be abolished.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>As the supply of foodstuffs will probably be normal in August next,
  the Food Ministry will cease to exist, its business being finished. This
  seems a pretty poor excuse for a Government Department to give for
  closing down.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Music is not heard by the ear alone," says M. <font
  class="sc">Jacques Dalcroze</font>. Experience proves that when the piano
  is going next door it is heard by the whole of the neighbour at once.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A weekly paper points out that there are at least thirty thousand
  unemployed persons in this country. This of course is very serious. After
  all you cannot have strikes unless the people are in work.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It appears that the dog (since destroyed) which was found wandering
  outside No. 10, Downing Street, had never tasted Prime Minister.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is reported that when Sir <font class="sc">David Burnett</font> put
  up Drury Lane Theatre for sale under the hammer the other day one
  gentleman offered to buy it on condition that the vendor papered the
  principal room and put a bath in.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A Bolton labourer who picked up twenty-five one-pound Treasury notes
  and restored them to the proper owner was rewarded with a shilling. It is
  only fair to say that the lady also said, "Thank you."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Asked what he would give towards a testimonial fund for a local hero
  one hardy Scot is reported to have said that he would give three
  cheers.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We learn on good authority that should a General Election take place
  during one of Mr. <font class="sc">Lloyd George's</font> visits to Paris
  <i>The Daily Mail</i> will undertake to keep him informed regarding the
  results by means of its Continental edition.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A sad story reaches us from South-West London. It appears that a girl
  of twenty attempted suicide because she realised she was too old to write
  either a popular novel or a book of poems.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Guards, it is stated, are to revert to the pre-war scarlet tunic
  and busby. Pre-war head-pieces, it may be added, are now worn exclusively
  at the War Office.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>At the Independent Labour Party's Victory dance it was stipulated that
  "evening dress and shirt sleeves are barred." This challenge to the upper
  classes (with whom shirt-sleeves are of course <i>de rigueur</i>) is not
  without its significance.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>As much alarm was caused by the announcement in these columns last
  week that the collapse of a wooden house was caused by a sparrow stepping
  on it, we feel we ought to mention that, owing to a sudden gust of wind,
  the bird in question leaned to one side, and it was simply this movement
  which caused the house to overbalance.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>[The revival, in certain quarters, of commercial relations with

  proposal to open up trade with the Co-operative Societies in Russia, to

<h2>WITH THE AUXILIARY PATROL.</h2>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">An Honourable Record.</font></p>

  <p>Many years ago, in the reign of good <font class="sc">Queen
  Victoria</font>, a little ship sailed out of Grimsby Docks in all the
  proud bravery of new paint and snow-white decks, and passed the Newsand
  bound for the Dogger Bank. They had christened her the <i>King
  George</i>, and, though her feminine susceptibilities were perhaps a
  trifle piqued at this affront to her sex, it was a right royal name, and
  her brand-new boilers swelled with loyal fervour. She was a steam
  trawler&mdash;at that time one of the smartest steam trawlers afloat, and
  she knew it; she held her headlights very high indeed, you may be
  sure.</p>

  <p>Time passed, and the winds and waters of the North Sea dealt all too
  rudely with the fair freshness of her exterior; she grew worn and
  weather-stained, and it was apparent even to the casual eye of a landsman
  that she had left her girlhood behind her out on the Nor'-East Rough.
  Some of the younger trawlers would jeeringly refer to her behind her back
  as "Auntie," and affected to regard her as an antediluvian old dowager,
  which of course was mainly due to jealousy. But she still pegged away at
  her work, bringing in from the Dogger week by week her cargoes of fish,
  regardless alike of the ravages of time and the jibes of her upstart
  rivals. As long as her owners were satisfied she was happy, for she
  cherished first and last a sense of duty, as all good ships do.</p>

  <p>And then suddenly came the War, infesting the seas with unaccustomed
  and nerve-racking dangers. I must apologise for mentioning this, as
  everybody knows that we ought now to forget about the War as quickly as
  possible and get on with more important matters, but at the time it had a
  certain effect upon us all, not excluding the <i>King George</i>.
  Scorning the menaces that lurked about her path she carried on the
  pursuit of the cod and haddock in her old undemonstrative fashion, for
  she was a British ship from stem to stern and conscious of the tradition
  behind her.</p>

  <p>Then one day they hauled her up in dock, gave her a six-pounder
  astern, fitted her with wireless and sent her out to take care of her
  unarmed sisters on the fishing-grounds. She flew the White Ensign.</p>

  <p>These were the proudest days of her life: she was helping to keep the
  seas. It is true the big ships of the Fleet might laugh at her in a
  good-natured way and pass uncomplimentary remarks about her personal
  appearance, but they had to acknowledge her seamanship and her pluck. She
  could buffet her way through weather that no destroyer dare face, and
  mines had no terrors for her, for even if she were to bump a tin-fish it
  only meant one old trawler the less, and the Navy could afford it.</p>

  <p>It was during these days, too, that she became known, though not by
  name, to readers of <i>Punch</i>, for her adventures and those of her
  crew were often chronicled in his tales of the "Auxiliary Patrol." And
  when she had seen the War through she said Good-bye to his pages and made
  ready to return again to the ways of peace. She was quite satisfied; she
  never thought of giving up her job, though she was now a very old ship,
  and it would have been no shame to her. She just took a fresh coat of
  paint and steamed away to the Dogger Bank once more.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The other day a small paragraph appeared in some of the newspapers
  that were not too busy discussing the possibilities of another railway
  strike: "The Grimsby trawler <i>King George</i>," it said, "is reported
  long over-due from the fishing-grounds, and the owners say that there is
  no hope of her return." No one would notice this, because the first round
  of the English Cup was to be played that week, and besides it was not as
  though it were a battleship or a big liner that had gone down. It was
  just the old <i>King George</i>.</p>

  <p>And that, I suppose, is the end of her, except that she may continue
  to be remembered by one or two who served aboard her in the days of the
  Auxiliary Patrol&mdash;remembered as a gallant little ship that served
  her country in its hour of need, and did not hold that hour the limit of
  her service. Well played, <i>King George</i>!</p>

<h2>A LIMPET OF WAR.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>With the British Army in France.</i>)</p>

  <p>The day on which that fine old crusted warrior, Major Slingswivel,
  quits the hospitable confines of Nullepart Camp will be the signal that
  the British Army in France has completed its work, even to the labelling
  and despatching of the last bundle of assorted howitzers. A British army
  in France without Major Slingswivel would be unthinkable. It is
  confidently asserted that Nullepart Camp was built round him when he
  landed in '14, and that he has only emerged from it on annual visits to
  his tailor for the purpose of affixing an additional chevron and having
  another inch let into his tunic. Latest reports state that he is still
  going strong, and indenting for ice-cream freezers in anticipation of a
  hot summer.</p>

  <p>But for an unforgivable error of tact I might have stood by the old
  brontosaurus to the bitter end. One evening he and I were listening to a
  concert given by the "Fluffy Furbelows" in the camp Nissen Coliseum, and
  a Miss Gwennie Gwillis was expressing an ardent desire to get back to
  Alabama and dear ole Mammy and Dad, not to speak of the rooster and the
  lil melon-patch way down by the swamp. The prospect as painted by her was
  so alluring that by the end of the first verse all the troops were
  infected with trans-Atlantic yearnings and voiced them in a manner that
  would have made an emigration agent rub his hands and start chartering
  transport right away. She had an enticing twinkle which lighted on the
  Major a few times, so that I wasn't surprised when the second chorus
  found him roaring out that he too was going to take a long lease of a
  shack down Alabama way.</p>

  <p>"Gad&mdash;she's immense! We must invite her to tea to-morrow," he
  said to me in a whisper that shook the Nissen hut to its foundations.
  Slingswivel was no vocal lightweight. Those people in Thanet and Kent who
  used to write to the papers saying they could hear the guns in the Vimy
  Ridge and Messines offensives were wrong. What they really heard was
  Major Slingswivel at Nullepart expostulating with his partner for
  declaring clubs on a no-trump hand.</p>

  <p>"Very well," I answered sulkily. It wasn't the first time the Major
  had been captivated by ladies with Southern syncopated tastes, and I knew
  I should be expected to complete the party with the other lady member of
  the troupe, Miss Dulcie Demiton, and listen to the old boy making very
  small talk in a very large voice. I could see myself balancing a teacup
  and trying to get in a word here and there through the barrage.</p>

  <p>Still, there was no getting out of it, and next afternoon found our
  quartette nibbling <i>petits gâteaux</i> in the only <i>pâtisserie</i> in
  the village. The Major was in fine fettle as the war-worn old veteran,
  and Gwennie and Dulcie spurred him on with open and undisguised
  admiration.</p>

  <p>"Now I'm in France," gushed Gwennie, "I want to see
  <i>everything</i>&mdash;where the trenches were and where you fought your
  terrible battles."</p>

  <p>"Delighted to show you," said Slingswivel, bursting with pride at
  being taken for a combatant officer. "How about to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"Just lovely," cooed Gwennie. "We're showing at Petiteville in the
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span>
  evening, but we shan't be starting before lunch."</p>

  <p>"That gives us all morning," said the Major enthusiastically. "Miss
  Gwennie, Miss Dulcie, Spenlow, we will parade to-morrow at 9.30."</p>

  <p>I couldn't understand it. Naturally Gwennie, with her mind constantly
  set on Alabama, couldn't be expected to be up in war geography, but the
  Major knew jolly well that all the battles within reasonable distance of
  Nullepart had been fought out with chits and indents. I put it to him
  that it wasn't likely country for war thrills.</p>

  <p>"Leave it to me," he said confidently.</p>

  <p>So I left it, and when we paraded next morning where do you think the
  wily old bird led us? Why, to the old training ground on the edge of the
  camp, where the R.E.'s used to lay out beautifully revetted geometrical
  trenches as models of what we were supposed to imitate in the front line
  between hates. Having been neglected since the Armistice they had caved
  in a bit and sagged round the corners till they were a very passable
  imitation of the crump-battered thing.</p>

  <p>Old Slingswivel so arranged the itinerary that the girls didn't
  perceive that the sector was bounded on one side by Père Popeau's turnip
  field and on the other by a duck-pond, and he showed a tactical knowledge
  of the value of cover in getting us into a trench out of view of certain
  stakes and pickets that were obviously used by Mère Popeau as a
  drying-ground. To divert attention he gave a vivid demonstration of
  bombing along a C.T. with clods of earth, with myself as bayonet-man
  nipping round traverses and mortally puncturing sand-bags with a
  walking-stick. It must have been a pretty nervy business for the Major,
  for any minute we might have come across a notice-board about the hours
  of working parties knocking off for dinner that would have given the
  whole show away. But he displayed fine qualities of leadership and
  presence of mind at critical moments, notably when Gwennie showed a
  disposition to explore a particular dug-out.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't advise you to go in there, Miss Gwennie," he said
  gravely.</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Gwennie apprehensively.</p>

  <p>"Not a pleasant sight for a lady," said the Major gruffly. "It upset
  <i>me</i> one day when I looked in."</p>

  <p>This was probable enough, for the Mess steward used it as a store for
  empty bottles.</p>

  <p>Gwennie shuddered and passed on.</p>

  <p>The Major mopped his forehead with relief and set the ladies
  souveniring among old water-tin stoppers, which he alleged to be the
  plugs of hand-grenades.</p>

  <p>Taking it all round, it was a successful morning's show, which did
  credit to the producer, and it was only spoiled when, so to speak, the
  curtain rolled down amidst thunders of applause.</p>

  <p>"We don't realize what we owe to gallant soldiers like you," said
  Gwennie admiringly.</p>

  <p>The Major waved a fat deprecating hand.</p>

  <p>"And Captain Spenlow has just been telling me," continued Gwennie,
  "that you occupied this sector all through the War and that you hung on
  right to the very last, <i>notwithstanding incredible efforts to dislodge
  you</i>."</p>

  <p>At this crude statement of the naked facts Slingswivel's face went a
  deeper shade of purple, and you can appreciate why I put in an urgent
  application for immediate release, on compassionate grounds, and why the
  Major gladly endorsed it.</p>

<h2>THE TRAGEDY OF AN AUTHOR'S WIFE.</h2>

  <p>"I won't stand it any longer," said Janet intensely, meeting me in the
  hall. "Take off your umbrella and listen to me."</p>

  <p>"It's off," I replied faintly, perceiving that something was all my
  fault. "Can't you hear it singing 'Niagara' in the porch?"</p>

  <p>I dropped the shopping on the floor and sat down to watch Janet
  walking up and down the room.</p>

  <p>"I want," she continued in the tone of one who has had nobody to be
  indignant with all day, "a divorce."</p>

  <p>"Who for?" I inquired. "Really, darling, we can't afford any more
  presents this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Me," she interrupted, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you have it for your birthday?" I suggested. "I may have
  some more money by then. Besides, I gave you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, I could not," replied Janet in a voice like the end of the world;
  "I want it now. I will not wear myself out trying to live up to an
  impossible ideal, and lose all my friends because they can't help
  comparing me with it. And it isn't even as if it were my own ideal. I
  never know what I've got to be like from one week to another. And what do
  I get for my struggles? Not even recognition, much less gratitude."</p>

  <p>"Janet," I said kindly, "I don't know <i>what</i> you're talking
  about. Who are these people who keep idealising you? I will not have you
  annoyed in this way. Send them to me and I'll put a little solid realism
  into their heads. I'll tell them what you really are, and that'll settle
  their unfortunate illusions. Dear old girl, don't worry so.... I'll soon
  put it right."</p>

  <p>Janet looked at me piercingly.</p>

  <p>"It's this," she said; "I keep having people to call on me."</p>

  <p>"I know," I answered, shuddering; "but I can't help it, can I? You
  shouldn't be so attractive."</p>

  <p>"Dear Willyum," she replied, "that's just the point; you <i>can</i>
  help it."</p>

  <p>"Stop calling me names and I'll see what can be done."</p>

  <p>"But it's part of my 'whimsical wit' to call you Willyum," she said
  grimly. "I understand that I am like that. People realise this when they
  read your articles, and immediately call to see if I'm true. I've read
  through nearly all your stories to-day, in between the visitors,
  and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I gripped her hand in silence.</p>

  <p>"I'm losing all my friends," she mourned, touched by my sympathy,
  "even those who used to like me long ago. Girls who knew me at school say
  to themselves, 'Fancy poor old Janet being like that all the time, and we
  never knew!' and they rush down to see me again. They sit hopefully round
  me as long as they can bear it; then, after the breakdown, they go away
  indignant and never think kindly of me again."</p>

  <p>She gloomed.</p>

  <p>"And all the cousins and nice young men who used to think I was quite
  jolly have suddenly noticed how much jollier I might be if only I could
  say the things they say you say I say...."</p>

  <p>"Hush, hush," I whispered; "have an aspirin."</p>

  <p>"But it's quite <i>true</i>," she cried hopelessly. "And She's just
  what I ought to be. She says everything just in the right place. When I
  compare myself with Her, I know I'm not a bit the kind of person you
  admire, and&mdash;and it's no good pretending any longer. I'm not
  jealous, only&mdash;sort of misrubble."</p>

  <p>She rose with a pale smile and, hushing my protestations, arrived at
  her conclusion.</p>

  <p>"We must part," she said, throwing her cigarette into the fire and
  walking to the window; "I can't help it. I suppose I'm not good enough
  for you. You must be free to marry Her when we find Her. I too," she
  sighed, "must be free...."</p>

  <p>"I now call upon myself to speak," I remarked, rising hurriedly.
  "Janet," I continued, arriving at her side, "keep perfectly still and do
  not attempt to breathe, because you will not be able to, and look as
  pleasant as you can while I tell you truthfully what I think you are
  really like."</p>

  <p>(I have been compelled to delete this passage on the ground that even
  if people believed me it would only attract more callers.)</p>

  <p>"All right," she continued, unruffling her hair; "but if I do you must
  promise to leave off writing stories about me. Will you?"</p>

  <p>"But, darling," I objected, "consider the bread-and-jam."</p>

  <p>She was silent.</p>

  <p>"Well, then," she said at last, "you must only write careful ones that
  I can live up to."</p>

  <p>"I'll try," I agreed remorsefully; "I'll go and do one now&mdash;all
  about this. And you can censor it." I left the room jauntily.</p>

  <p>Janet's voice, suddenly repentant, followed me.</p>

  <p>"No," she called, "that won't do either. Because if it's a true one
  you won't sell it."</p>

  <p>"But if it isn't," I called back, "and I do, we can put the money in
  the Divorce Fund."</p>

<h2>THE JUMBLE SALE.</h2>

  <p>Aunt Angela coughed. "By the way, Etta was here this afternoon."</p>

  <p>Edward's eye met mine. The result of Etta's last call was that Edward
  spent a vivid afternoon got up as Father Christmas in a red dressing-gown
  and cotton-wool whiskers, which caught fire and singed his home-grown
  articles, small boys at the same time pinching his legs to see if he was
  real, while I put in some sultry hours under a hearthrug playing the
  benevolent polar-bear to a crowd of small girls who hunted me with
  fire-irons.</p>

  <p>"What is it this time?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"A jumble sale," said Aunt Angela.</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>"A scheme by which the bucolic English exchange garbage," Edward
  explained.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, that has nothing to do with us, thank goodness."</p>

  <p>He returned to his book, a romance entitled <i>Gertie, or Should She
  Have Done It?</i> Edward, I should explain, is a philosopher by trade,
  but he beguiles his hours of ease with works of fiction borrowed from the
  cook.</p>

  <p>Aunt Angela was of a different opinion. "Oh, yes, it has: both of you
  are gradually filling the house up with accumulated rubbish. If you don't
  surrender most of it for Etta's sale there'll be a raid."</p>

  <p>My eye met Edward's. We walked out into the hall.</p>

  <p>"We'll have to give Angela something or she'll tidy us," he
  groaned.</p>

  <p>"These orderly people are a curse," I protested. "They have no
  consideration for others. Look at me; I am naturally disorderly, but I
  don't run round and untidy people's houses for them."</p>

  <p>Edward nodded. "I know; I know it's all wrong, of course; we should
  make a stand. Still, if we can buy Angela off, I think ... you
  understand?..." And he ambled off to his muck-room.</p>

  <p>If anybody in this neighbourhood has anything that is both an eyesore
  and an encumbrance they bestow it on Edward for his muck-room, where he
  stores it against an impossible contingency. I trotted upstairs to my
  bedroom and routed about among my <i>Lares et Penates</i>. I have many
  articles which, though of no intrinsic value, are bound to me by strong
  ties of sentiment; little old bits of things&mdash;you know how it is.
  After twenty minutes' heart-and-drawer-searching I decided to sacrifice a
  policeman's helmet and a sock, the upper of which had outlasted the toe
  and heel. I bore these downstairs and laid them at Aunt Angela's
  feet.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" said she, stirring the helmet disdainfully with her
  toe.</p>

  <p>"Relic of the Great War. The Crown Prince used to wear it in wet
  weather to keep the crown dry."</p>

  <p>Aunt Angela sniffed and picked up the sock with the fire-tongs. "And
  this?"</p>

  <p>"A sock, of course," I explained. "An emergency sock of my own
  invention. It has three exits, you will observe, very handy in case of
  fire."</p>

  <p>"Hump!" said Aunt Angela.</p>

  <p>Edward returned bearing his offerings, a gent's rimless boater, a
  doorknob, six inches of lead-piping and half a bottle of cod-liver
  oil.</p>

  <p>"Hump!" said Aunt Angela.</p>

  <p>No more was said of it that night. Aunt Angela resumed her sewing,
  Edward his <i>Gertie</i>, I my slumb&mdash;, my meditations. Nor indeed
  was the jumble sale again mentioned, a fact which in itself should have
  aroused my suspicions; but I am like that, innocent as a sucking-dove. I
  had put the matter out of my mind altogether until yesterday evening,
  when, hearing the sound of laboured breathing and the frantic clanking of
  a bicycle pump proceeding from the shed, I went thither to investigate,
  and was nearly capsized by Edward charging out.</p>

  <p>"It's gone," he cried&mdash;"gone!" and pawed wildly for his
  stirrup.</p>

  <p>"What has?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"'The Limit,'" he wailed. "She's picked ... lock ... muck-room with a
  hairpin, sent ... Limit ... jumble sale!"</p>

  <p>He sprang aboard his cycle and disappeared down the high road to St.
  Gwithian, pedalling like a squirrel on a treadmill, the tails of his new
  mackintosh spread like wings on the breeze. So Aunt Angela with
  serpentine guile had deferred her raid until the last moment and then
  bagged "The Limit," the pride of the muck-room.</p>

  <p>"The Limit," I should tell you, is (or was) a waterproof. It is a
  faithful record of Edward's artistic activities during the last thirty
  years, being decorated all down the front with smears of red, white and
  green paint. Here and there it has been repaired with puncture patches
  and strips of surgical plaster, but more often it has not. As Edward is
  incapable of replacing a button and Aunt Angela refuses to touch the
  "Limit," he knots himself into it with odds and ends of string and has to
  be liberated by his ally, the cook, with a kitchen knife. Edward calls it
  his "garden coat," and swears he only wears it on dirty jobs, to save his
  new mackintosh, but nevertheless he is sincerely attached to the rag, and
  once attempted to travel to London to a Royal Society beano in it, and
  was only frustrated in the nick of time.</p>

  <p>So the oft-threatened "Limit" had been reached at last. I laughed
  heartily for a moment, then a sudden cold dread gripped me, and I raced
  upstairs and tore open my wardrobe. Gregory, the glory of Gopherville,
  had gone too!</p>

  <p>A word as to Gregory. If you look at a map of Montana and follow a
  line due North through from Fort Custer you will not find Gopherville,
  because a cyclone removed it some eight years ago. Nine years ago,
  however, Gregory and I first met in the "Bon Ton Parisian Clothing
  Store," in the main (and only) street of Gopherville, and I secured him
  for ten dollars cash. He is a mauve satin waistcoat, embroidered with a
  chaste design of anchors and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"
  id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span> forget-me-nots, subtly suggesting
  perennial fidelity. The combination of Gregory and me proved irresistible
  at all Gopherville's social events.</p>

  <p>Wishing to create a favourable atmosphere, I wore Gregory at my first
  party in England. I learn that Aunt Angela disclaimed all knowledge of me
  during that evening.</p>

  <p>Subsequently she made several determined attempts to present Gregory
  to the gardener, the butcher's boy and to an itinerant musician as an
  overcoat for his simian colleague. Had I foiled her in all of these to be
  beaten in the end? No, not without a struggle. I scampered downstairs
  again and, wresting Harriet's bicycle from its owner's hands (Harriet is
  the housemaid and it was her night out), was soon pedalling furiously
  after Edward.</p>

  <p>The jumble sale was being held in the schools and all St. Gwithian was
  there, fighting tooth and nail over the bargains. A jumble sale is to
  <i>rus</i> what remnant sales are to <i>urbs</i>. I battled my way round
  to each table in turn, but nowhere could I find my poor dear old Gregory.
  Then I saw Etta, the presiding genius, and butted my way towards her.</p>

  <p>"Look here," I gasped&mdash;"have you by any chance seen&mdash;?" I
  gave her a full description of the lost one.</p>

  <p>Etta nodded. "Sort of illuminated horse-blanket? Oh, yes, I should say
  I have."</p>

  <p>"Tell me," I panted&mdash;"tell me, is it sold yet? Who bought it?
  Where is&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"It's not sold <i>yet</i>," said Etta calmly. "There was such rivalry
  over it that it's going to be raffled. Tickets half-a-crown each. Like
  one?"</p>

  <p>"But it's <i>mine</i>!" I protested.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, it's <i>mine</i>; Angela gave it to me. If you care
  to buy all the tickets&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"How much?" I growled.</p>

  <p>"Four pounds."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but that's twice as much as I paid for it originally!"</p>

  <p>"I know," said Etta sweetly, "but prices have risen terribly owing to
  the War."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I found Edward outside leaning on his jaded velocipede. He was wearing
  the "Limit."</p>

  <p>"Hello," said he, "got what you wanted?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I, "and so, I observe, did you. How much did <i>you</i>
  have to pay?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said he triumphantly; "Etta took my new mackintosh in
  exchange," he chuckled. "I think we rather scored off Angela this time,
  don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I&mdash;"ye-es."</p>

<h2>THE MOO-COW.</h2>

  <p>I was getting so tired of the syncopated life of town (and it didn't
  fit in with my present literary work) that I bribed my old pal Hobson to
  exchange residences with me for six months, with option; so now he has my
  flat in town, complete with Underground Railway and street noises (to say
  nothing of jazz music wherever he goes), and I have his country cottage,
  old-fashioned and clean, and a perfectly heavenly silence to listen to.
  Still, there <i>are</i> noises, and their comparative infrequency makes
  them the more noticeable. There is, for instance, a cow that bothers me
  more than a little. It has chosen, or there has been chosen, for its day
  nursery a field adjoining my (really Hobson's) garden. It has selected a
  spot by the hedge, almost under the study window, as a fit and proper
  place for its daily round of mooing.</p>

  <p>Possibly this was at Hobson's request. Perhaps he likes the sound of
  mooing, or, conceivably, the cow doesn't like Hobson, and moos to annoy
  him. But surely it cannot mistake me for him. We are not at all alike. He
  is short and dark; I am tall and fair. This has given rise to a question
  in my mind: Can cows distinguish between human beings?</p>

  <p>Anyway the cow worries me with its continual fog-horn, and I thought I
  would write to the owner (a small local dairy-farmer) to see if he could
  manage to find another field in which to batten this cow, where it could
  moo till it broke its silly tonsils for all I should care; so I indited
  this to him:&mdash;</p>

  <p><font class="sc">My dear Sir</font>,&mdash;You have in your entourage
  a cow that is causing me some annoyance. It is one of those red-and-white
  cows (an Angora or Pomeranian perhaps; I don't know the names of the
  different breeds, being a town mouse), and it has horns of which one is
  worn at an angle of fifteen or twenty degrees higher than the other. This
  may help you to identify it. It possesses, moreover, a moo which is a
  blend between a ship's siren and a taxicab's honk syringe. If you haven't
  heard either of these instruments you may take my word for them. Further,
  I think it may really assist you if I describe its tail. The last two
  feet of it have become unravelled, and the upper part is red, with a
  white patch where the tail is fastened on to the body.</p>

  <p>It is only the moo part of the cow that is annoying me; I like the
  rest of it. I am engaged in writing a book on the Dynamic Force of Modern
  Art, and a solo on the Moo does not blend well with such labour as
  mine.</p>

  <p>There are hens here at Hillcroft. This remark may seem irrelevant, but
  not if you read on. Every time one of these hens brings
  five-pence-halfpenny worth of egg into the world it makes a noise
  commensurate with this feat. But I contend that even if your cow laid an
  egg every time it moos (which it doesn't, so far as my survey reveals)
  its idiotic bellowing would still be out of all proportion to the
  achievement. Even milk at a shilling a quart scarcely justifies such
  assertiveness.</p>

  <p>My friend Mr. Hobson may, of course, have offended the animal in
  question, but even so I cannot see why I should have to put up with its
  horrible revenge; which brings me to the real and ultimate reason for
  troubling you, and that is, to ask you if you will be so good as to tell
  the cow to desist, and, in case of its refusal, to <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span> remove it
  to other quarters. If the annoyance continues I cannot answer for the
  consequences.</p>

  lay 'ands on my cow i'll 'ave the lor of you.</p>

  <p>Yours obedient <font class="sc">Henry Gibbs</font>.</p>

  <p>I felt that I hadn't got off very well with Henry, and thought I would
  try again, so wrote:&mdash;</p>

  <p><font class="sc">Dear Mr. Gibbs</font>,&mdash;Thank you so much for
  your too delightful letter. I am afraid you somewhat misapprehended the
  purport of mine. I freely admit your right to turn all manner of beasts
  into your demesne; equally do I concede to them the right to play upon
  such instruments as Nature has handed out to them; but I also claim the
  right to be allowed to carry on my work undisturbed. The consequences
  would be to me, not to the cow, unless laryngitis supervenes. I love
  cows, and I greatly admire this particular cow, but not its moo; that is
  all.</p>

  <p>Is it, do you suppose, uttering some Jeremiad or prophecy? Can it, for
  example, be foretelling the doom of the middle classes? Or is it possible
  that our noisy friend is uttering a protest against some injurious
  treatment received from its master?</p>

  <p>I have discovered that our daily supply of milk is supplied by your
  herd, and on inquiry I find that our cook is not at all confident that a
  quart of the same as delivered to us would satisfy the requirements of
  the Imperial standard of measurement.</p>

  <p>If the animal's fog-horn continues I shall take it as an indignant
  protest against a slight that has been cast on its fertility, and shall
  seriously think of calling in the Food-Inspector to examine you in the
  table of liquid measure.</p>

  <p>Delightful weather we have been experiencing, have we not?</p>

  <p>I do not know how much my correspondent understood of this letter,
  but, as the moo-cow was shortly afterwards relegated to fresh pastures,
  and as we are getting decidedly better measure for our milk money, I
  gather that he had enough intelligence for my purposes.</p>

  <p>The threat which I thus put at a venture may be recommended to anyone
  suffering from the moo nuisance.</p>

<h3>GOLDEN GEESE.</h3>

  <p>The London University Correspondent of <i>The Observer</i> has been
  deploring the fact that a number of professors and lecturers have lately
  resigned their poorly-paid academic positions in order to take up
  commercial and industrial posts at much higher salaries. Among the
  instances he cites is that of a Professor of Chemistry at King's College,
  who has been appointed Director of Research to the British Cotton
  Industry Research Association.</p>

  <p>The movement, which the writer denounces as bearing "too obvious an
  analogy to the killing of the golden goose," is not however confined to
  London University. From the great seats of learning all over the country
  the same complaint is heard. We learn, for instance, that Mr. Angus
  McToddie, until recently Professor of Physics at the John Walker
  University, N.B., has vacated that post on his appointment as
  Experimental Adviser to the British Constitutional Whisky Manufacturers'
  Association.</p>

  <p>Past and present <i>alumni</i> of Tonypandy will learn with regret
  that the University is to lose the services of its Professor of Live
  Languages, Mr. O. Evans, who is about to assume the responsible and
  highly-remunerated position of Director of Research to the Billingsgate
  Fishporters' Self-Help Society.</p>

  <p>The Egregius Professor of Ancient History at Giggleswick University
  will shortly take up his duties as Editor of <i>Chestnuts</i>, the new
  comic weekly.</p>

  <p>Professor Ernest Grubb, who for many years has adorned the Chair of
  Entomology at Durdleham, is about to enter the dramatic sphere as
  stage-manager to a well-known troupe of performing insects.</p>

  <p>Another recruit to Stage enterprise is Professor Seymour Legge, who
  has been appointed Chief Investigator to the Beauty Chorus Providers'
  Corporation. Mr. Legge was formerly Professor of Comparative Anatomy at
  Ballycorp.</p>

<h2>THE RIDING LESSON.</h2>

  <p>Phillida arrived up to time with her suit-case, a riding-crop and a
  large copy of <font class="sc">D'Aulnoy's</font> <i>Fairy Tales</i>. She
  was not very communicative as we drove out, and I sought to draw her. You
  never, by the way, talk down to Phillida. Personally, I don't believe in
  talking down to any child; but to employ this method with Phillida is to
  court disaster.</p>

  <p>"Pleasant journey?" I inquired casually, flicking Rex's ear.</p>

  <p>"'M," responded Phillida in the manner of a child sucking sweets.
  Phillida was not sucking sweets, and I accepted my snub. We drove on for
  a bit in silence. Phillida removed her hat, and her bobbed hair went all
  round her head like a brown busby. I looked round and was embarrassed to
  find the straight grey eyes fixed on my face, the expression in them
  almost rapturous.</p>

  <p>"Jolly country, isn't it?" I essayed hurriedly, with a comprehensive
  wave of my whip.</p>

  <p>The preoccupied "'M" was repeated with even less emphasis.</p>

  <p>Another protracted silence. I decided not to interfere with the course
  of nature as manifested in one small grey-eyed maiden of eight. Presently
  there burst from her ecstatically, "Uncle Dick, is this the one I'm going
  to ride?" So that was it. From that moment we got on splendidly. We
  discussed, agreed and disagreed over breeds, paces, sizes. I told her the
  horse she would ride would be twice the size of Rex, and she nearly fell
  out of the trap when I said we might go together that very afternoon.</p>

  <p>"I've not learned to gallop," she remarked with some reluctance; "but
  of course you could teach me."</p>

  <p>I had only heard the vaguest rumours of her riding experience, and she
  was very mysterious about it herself. However, when she came downstairs
  at the appointed time, in her brown velvet jockey-cap, top-boots,
  breeches and gloves complete, she looked so determined and efficient I
  felt reassured.</p>

  <p>I had to make holes in the stirrup leathers eleven inches higher than
  the top one of all before she could touch the irons; but she settled into
  the saddle with great firmness and we were off without any fuss. Once on
  a horse, she had no difficulty in maintaining a perfect continuity of
  speech, and I soon felt relieved of all anxiety about her safety. If she
  was not an old and practised hand, she had nerve and balance, and I did
  not think fit to produce the leading rein which I had smuggled into my
  pocket.</p>

  <p>We trotted a perfect three miles, and she had an eye to the country
  and a word to say about all she saw. When we turned to come back, I felt
  Brimstone make his usual spurt forward, but I was not prepared for
  Treacle's sudden break away. He was off like a rocket. That small child's
  cap was flung across my eyes in a sudden gust. I had retrieved it in a
  second, but it was time lost, and, by Jove! she was out of sight round a
  bend. I followed after, might and main, but the racket of Brimstone's
  hoofs only sent Treacle flying faster. I caught sight of the small figure
  leaning back, the bright hair flying. Then they were gone again. My heart
  beat very fast. "She had never learned to gallop!" At every bend I hardly
  dared to look for what I might find. I knew Treacle, once started, would
  dash for home. If the child could only stick it, all might be well. I
  pounded along, and after a two-mile run I came on them. She had pulled
  him in and was walking him, waiting for me, a little turned in the
  saddle, one minute hand resting lightly on his broad back. She was
  prettily flushed, her hair blown, but she hadn't even lost her crop.</p>

  <p>"Did you stop to get my cap?" she said as we came up. "Thanks
  awfully."</p>

  <p>I wanted to hug the little thing, but her dignity forbade any such
  exhibition.</p>

  <p>The only other reference to the afternoon's experience was on a
  postcard I happened to see written the same night, addressed to her
  mother.</p>

  <p>"<font class="sc">Darling Bee</font>" (it ran in very large baby
  characters),&mdash;"I had the most adorable ride to-day I ever had. I
  learned to galup all by myself. I thaut at first the horse was running
  away with me, but Uncle Dick soon caut me up. He had my cap.</p>

<h3>MORE CHAMPIONSHIPS.</h3>

  <p>The sporting public is so intrigued by the prospect of a <font
  class="sc">Dempsey-Carpentier</font> match that other impending
  championship events are in danger of being forgotten.</p>

  <p>The present position in the challenge for the World's Halma
  Championship is this. Mr. George P. Henrun is patriotically endeavouring
  to secure the contest for Britain, and to that end has put up a purse of
  half-a-guinea. The Société Halma de Bordeaux has cut in with a firm offer
  of twenty-two francs, and the matter now remains in abeyance while
  financial advisers calculate the rate of exchange in order to ascertain
  which proposal is the more advantageous. The challenger, of course, is
  Tommy Jupes, aged twelve, of Ashby-de-la-Zouche. His opponent, the
  champion, has an advantage of three years in age and two inches in reach,
  but the strategy of Master Jupes is said to be irresistible. Only last
  week he overwhelmed his mother, herself a scratch player, when conceding
  her four men and the liberty to cheat twice.</p>

  <p>The public will be thrilled to hear that a match has now been arranged
  between the two lady aspirants for the World's Patience Championship,
  <i>viz.</i>, Miss Tabitha Templeman, of Bath, and Miss Priscilla J.
  Jarndyce, of Washington. To meet the territorial prejudices of both
  ladies the contest will take place in mid-Atlantic, on a liner. There
  will be no seconds, but Miss Templeman will be accompanied by the pet
  Persian, which she always holds in her lap while playing, and Miss
  Jarndyce will bring with her the celebrated foot-warmer which is
  associated with her greatest triumphs. The vexed question of the
  allocation of cinema royalties has been settled through the tact of Mr.
  Manketlow Spefforth, author of <i>Patience for the Impatient</i>. One
  lady wanted the royalties to be devoted to a Home for Stray Cats, and the
  other expressed a desire to benefit the Society for the Preservation of
  Wild Bird Life. Mr. Spefforth's happy compromise is that the money shall
  be assigned to the Fund in aid of Distressed Spinsters.</p>

  <p>Bert Hawkins, of Whitechapel, has expressed his willingness, on
  suitable terms, to meet T'gumbu, the powerful Matabele, in a twenty-ball
  contest for the World's Cokernut-Shying Championship. There is however a
  deadlock over details. T'gumbu's manager is adamant that the match shall
  take place in his nominee's native village of Mpm, but Mr. Hawkins
  objects, seeing little chance of escaping alive after the victory of
  which he is so confident. He says he would "feel more safer like on
  'Ampstead 'Eaf." Another difficulty is that Mr. Hawkins insists on
  wearing his <i>fiancée's</i> headgear while competing, and this is
  regarded by T'gumbu as savouring of witchcraft. Mr. Hawkins generously
  offers his opponent permission to wear any article of his wives'
  clothing; but the coloured candidate quite reasonably retorts that this
  concession is practically valueless. On one point fortunately there is
  unaniminity: both parties are firm that all bad nuts must be
  replaced.</p>

<h2>BOOKS AND BACKS.</h2>

  <p>The proposal to revive the old "yellow back" cover for novels, partly
  in the interest of economy in production, partly to attract the purchaser
  by the lure of colour, has caused no little stir in the literary world.
  In order to clarify opinion on the subject Mr. Punch has been at pains to
  secure the following expressions of their views from some of the leading
  authors of both sexes:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Mr. J.M. <font class="sc">Keynes</font>, C.B., the author of the most
  sensational book of the hour, contributed some interesting observations
  on the economics of the dye industry and their bearing on the question.
  These we are reluctantly obliged to omit. We may note however his general
  conclusion that the impact on the public mind of a book often varies in
  an inverse ratio with the attractiveness of its appearance or its title.
  At the same time he admits that if he had called his momentous work
  <i>The Terrible Treaty</i>, and if it had been bound in a rainbow cover
  with a Cubist design, its circulation might have been even greater than
  it actually is. But then, as he candidly owns, "as a Cambridge man, I may
  be inclined to attach an undue importance to 'Backs.'"</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Frederic Harrison</font> writes: "<font
  class="sc">Matt. Arnold</font> once chaffed me for keeping a guillotine
  in my back-garden. But my real colour was never sea-green in politics any
  more than it is yellow in literature or journalism. Yet I have a great
  tenderness for the old yellow-backs of fifty years ago. Yellow Books are
  another story. The yellow-backs may have sometimes affronted the eye, but
  for the most part they were dove-like in their outlook. Now 'red ruin and
  the breaking-up of laws' flaunt themselves in the soberest livery. I do
  not often drop into verse, but this inversion of the old order has
  suggested these lines, which you may care to print:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"'In an age mid-Victorian and mellow,</p>
      <p class="i2">Ere the current of life ran askew,</p>
      <p>The backs of our novels were yellow,</p>
      <p class="i2">Their hearts were of Quaker-like hue;</p>
      <p>But now, when extravagant lovers</p>
      <p class="i2">Their hectic emotions parade,</p>
      <p>In sober or colourless covers</p>
      <p class="i2">We find them arrayed.'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Charles Garvice</font> points out that the choice
  of colour in bindings calls for especial care and caution at the present
  time, owing to the powerful influence of association. Yellow might lend
  impetus to the Yellow Peril. Red is especially to be avoided owing to its
  unfortunate appropriation by Revolutionary propagandists. Blue, though
  affected by statisticians and Government publishers, has a traditional
  connection with the expression of sentiments of an antinomian and
  heterodox character. At all costs the sobriety and dignity of fiction
  should be maintained, and sparing use should be made of the brighter hues
  of the spectrum. He had forgotten a good deal of his Latin, but there
  still lingered in his memory the old warning: "<i>O formose puer, nimium
  ne crede colori</i>."</p>

  <p>Miss <font class="sc">Daisy Ashford</font>, another of our "best
  sellers," demurs to the view that a gaudy or garish exterior is needed to
  catch the public eye. The enlightened child-author scorned such devices.
  Books, like men and women&mdash;especially women&mdash;ought not to be
  judged by their backs, but by their hearts. She confessed, however, to a
  weakness for "jackets" as a form of attire peculiarly consecrated to
  youth.</p>

  <p>Madame <font class="sc">Montessori</font> cables from Rome as
  follows:&mdash;"The colour of book-covers is of vital importance in
  education. I wish to express my strong conviction that, where books for
  the young are concerned, no action should be taken by publishers without
  holding an unfettered plébiscite of all children under twelve. Also that
  the polychromatic series of Fairy Stories edited by the late Mr. <font
  class="sc">Andrew Lang</font> should be at once withdrawn from
  circulation, not only because of the reckless and unscientific colour
  scheme adopted, but to check the wholesale dissemination of futile fables
  concocted and invented by irresponsible adults of all ages and
  countries."</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p>In the war-after-the-war, the bombardment of books that is now so
  violently raging upon all fronts, any contribution by a writer as eminent
  as Lord <font class="sc">Haldane</font> naturally commands the respect
  due to weapons of the heaviest calibre. Unfortunately "heavy" is here an
  epithet unkindly apt, since it has to be admitted that the noble lord
  wields a pen rather philosophic than popular, with the result that
  <i>Before the War</i> (<font class="sc">Cassell</font>) tells a story of
  the highest interest in a manner that can only be called ponderous. Our
  ex-War Minister is, at least chiefly, responding to the literary
  offensives of <font class="sc">Bethmann-Hollweg</font> and <font
  class="sc">Tirpitz</font>, in connection with whose books his should be
  read, if the many references are properly to be understood. As every
  reader will know, however, Lord <font class="sc">Haldane</font> could
  hardly have delivered his apologia before the accuser without the gates
  and not at the same time had an eye on the critic within. Fortunately it
  is here no part of a reviewer's task to obtrude his own political
  theories. With regard to the chief indictment, of having permitted the
  country to be taken unawares, the author betrays his legal training by a
  defence which is in effect (1) that circumstances compelled our being so
  taken, and that (2) we weren't. On this and other matter, however, the
  individual reader, having paid his money (7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. net),
  remains at liberty to take his choice. One revelation at least emerges
  clearly enough from Lord <font class="sc">Haldane's</font>
  pages&mdash;the danger of playing diplomat to a democracy. "Extremists,
  whether Chauvinist or Pacifist, are not helpful in avoiding wars" is one
  of many conclusions, double-edged perhaps, to which he is led by
  retrospect of his own trials. His book, while making no concessions to
  the modern demand for vivacity, is one that no student of the War and its
  first causes can neglect.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is not Mr. <font class="sc">L. Cope Cornford's</font> fault that
  his initials are identical with those of the London County Council, nor
  do I consider it to be mine that his rather pontifical attitude towards
  men and matters reminds me of that august body. Anyone ignorant of recent
  inventions might be excused for thinking that <i>The Paravane
  Adventure</i> (<font class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</font>) is the title
  of a stirring piece of sensational fiction. But fiction it is not, though
  in some of its disclosures it may be considered sensational enough. In
  this history of the invention of the Paravane Mr. <font
  class="sc">Cornford</font> hurls a lot of well-directed bricks at
  Officialdom, and concludes his book by giving us his frank opinion of the
  way in which the Navy ought to be run. It is impossible, even if one does
  not subscribe to all his ideas, to refrain from commending the enthusiasm
  with which he writes of those who, in spite of great difficulties, set to
  work to invent and perfect the Paravane. If you don't know what a
  Paravane is I have neither the space nor the ability to tell you; but Mr.
  <font class="sc">Cornford</font> has, and it's all in the book.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A stray paragraph in a contemporary, to the effect that the portrait
  of the heroine and the story of her life in Baroness <font class="sc">von
  Hutten's</font> <i>Happy House</i> (<font class="sc">Hutchinson</font>)
  is a transcript of actual fact, saves me from the indiscretion of <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span> declaring
  that I found <i>Mrs. Walbridge</i> and her egregious husband and the
  general situation at Happy House frankly incredible. Pleasantly
  incredible, I should have added; and I rather liked the young man,
  <i>Oliver</i>, from Fleet Street, whom the Great Man had recently made
  Editor of <i>Sparks</i> and who realised that he was destined to be a
  titled millionaire, for is not that the authentic procedure? Hence his
  fanatical obstinacy in wooing his, if you ask me, none too desirable
  bride. I hope I am not doing the author a disservice in describing this
  as a thoroughly wholesome book, well on the side of the angels. It has
  the air of flowing easily from a practised pen. But nothing will induce
  me to believe that <i>Mrs. Walbridge</i>, putting off her Victorian airs,
  did win the prize competition with a novel in the modern manner.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Alexander Macfarlan's</font> new story, <i>The
  Inscrutable Lovers</i> (<font class="sc">Heinemann</font>), is not the
  first to have what one may call Revolutionary Ireland for its background,
  but it is by all odds the most readable, possibly because it is not in
  any sense a political novel. It is in characters rather than events that
  the author interests himself. A highly refined, well-to-do and extremely
  picturesque Irish revolutionary, whom the author not very happily
  christens <i>Count Kettle</i>, has a daughter who secretly abhors romance
  and the high-falutin sentimentality that he and his circle mistake for
  patriotism. To her father's disgust she marries an apparently staid and
  practical young Scotch ship-owner, who at heart is a confirmed romantic.
  The circumstances which lead to their marriage and the subsequent events
  which reveal to each the other's true temperament provide the "plot" of
  <i>The Inscrutable Lovers</i>. Though slender it is original and might
  lend itself either to farce or tragedy. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Macfarlan's</font> attitude is pleasantly analytical. It is
  indeed his delightful air of remote criticism, his restrained and
  epigrammatic style queerly suggestive of <font class="sc">Romain
  Roland</font> in <i>The Market Place</i>, and his extremely clever
  portraiture, rather than any breadth or depth appertaining to the story
  itself, that entitle the author to a high place among the young novelists
  of to-day. Mr. <font class="sc">Macfarlan</font>&mdash;is he by any
  chance the Rev. <font class="sc">Alexander Macfarlan</font>?&mdash;may
  and doubtless will produce more formidable works of fiction in due
  course; he will scarcely write anything smoother, more sparing of the
  superfluous word or that offers a more perfect blend of sympathy and
  analysis.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Susie</i> (<font class="sc">Duckworth</font>) is the story of a
  minx or an exposition of the eternal feminine according to the reader's
  own convictions. I am not sure&mdash;and I suppose that places me among
  those who regard her heroine as the mere minx&mdash;that the Hon. Mrs.
  <font class="sc">Dowdall</font> has done well in expending so much
  cleverness in telling <i>Susie's</i> story. Certainly those who think of
  marriage as a high calling, for which the vocation is love, will be as
  much annoyed with her as was her cousin <i>Lucy</i>, the idealist, at
  once the most amusing and most pathetic figure in the book. I am quite
  sure that Susies and Lucys both abound, and that Mrs. <font
  class="sc">Dowdall</font> knows all about them; but I am not equally sure
  that the Susies deserve the encouragement of such a brilliant dissection.
  Yet the men whose happiness she played with believed in <i>Susie's</i>
  representation of herself as quite well-meaning, and other women who saw
  through her liked her in spite of their annoyance; and&mdash;after all
  the other things I have said&mdash;I am bound, in sincerity, to admit
  that I liked her too.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>You could scarcely have given a novelist a harder case than to prove
  the likeableness of <i>Cherry Mart</i>, as her actions show her in
  <i>September</i> (<font class="sc">Methuen</font>), and I wonder how a
  Victorian writer would have dealt with the terrible chit. But <font
  class="sc">Frank Swinnerton</font>, of course, is able to hold these
  astonishing briefs with ease. Here is a girl who first turns the head of
  <i>Marian Forster's</i> middle-aged husband in a pure fit of
  experimentalism, and then sets her cap with defiant malice at the young
  man who seems likely to bring real love into the elder woman's life. And
  yet <i>Marian</i> grows always fonder of her, and she, in the manner of a
  wayward and naughty child, of <i>Marian</i>. Insolence and
  <i>gaucherie</i> are on the one hand, coolness and finished grace on the
  other, and, although there are several moments of hatred between the two,
  their affection is the proper theme of the book. As for <i>Nigel</i>, he
  is impetuous and handsome, and falls in love with <i>Marian</i> because
  she is sympathetic, and with <i>Cherry</i> because she is <i>Cherry</i>,
  and also perhaps a little because the War has begun and the day of youth
  triumphant has arrived. But he does not make a very deep impression upon
  me, and as for <i>Marian's</i> husband, who is big and rather stupid, and
  always has been, I gather, a bit of a dog, he scarcely counts at all.
  <i>Marian</i>, however, is an extremely clever and intricate study, and
  for <i>Cherry</i>&mdash;I don't really know whether I like <i>Cherry</i>
  or not. But I have certainly met her.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
